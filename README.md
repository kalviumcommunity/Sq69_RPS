# Virtual Rock, Paper, Scissors League

## Project Overview
The Virtual Rock, Paper, Scissors League is an interactive web app where users can compete against one another in a series of Rock, Paper, Scissors matches, participate in tournaments, and track their performance through rankings and trophies. Users can challenge others in real-time gameplay, with matches being updated instantly using Socket.IO. The app will feature a dynamic leaderboard that ranks players based on their wins and losses, and a trophy system that rewards players with virtual trophies for their achievements. Players will also have a personalized profile where they can view their match history, including stats like win/loss ratio, recent matches, and tournament participation. The ultimate goal of the app is to create a fun, competitive environment where players can interact, test their luck, and have some lighthearted fun with a classic game.

And by creating this app, I aim to combine the excitement of real-time multiplayer interaction with a unique and playful theme that stands out. The app will not only feature the core Rock, Paper, Scissors game mechanics but will also introduce tournaments, where players can join or create tournaments, compete against others, and climb the ranks for the coveted trophy titles. This project allows me to explore and implement various concepts in the MERN stack, including user authentication, real-time communications, database management, and tournament logic, while keeping things fun and engaging.
